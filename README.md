# Java To-Do List Application

This project is a simple To-Do list application built with Java Swing. It was developed as part of a Java Developer Internship task to demonstrate fundamental skills in building desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **Add Tasks**: Users can type a task into a text field and add it to the list by clicking a button.
-   **Delete Tasks**: Users can select a task from the list and remove it.
-   **Scrollable List**: The task list is scrollable, allowing it to handle a large number of tasks without the window size changing.
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing daily tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **Java**: The core programming language.
-   **Swing**: The built-in Java GUI toolkit used to create the graphical user interface.
-   **Layout Managers**: `BorderLayout` and `FlowLayout` were used to organize the components within the application window.
-   **Event Handling**: `ActionListener` was implemented to respond to user interactions, such as button clicks.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project consists of a single Java class that contains all the GUI components and application logic.

-   `src/com/example/todo/ToDoAppGUI.java`: Contains the main class for the To-Do list application.

## üì¶ How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites

-   Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher).
-   An IDE like **Eclipse** or **IntelliJ IDEA**.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    `git clone [Your-GitHub-Repo-Link]`
2.  **Open the project in your IDE:**
    * In Eclipse, go to `File` > `Import` > `General` > `Existing Projects into Workspace`. Select the cloned folder.
3.  **Run the application:**
    * Navigate to the `ToDoAppGUI.java` file.
    * Right-click on the file and select `Run As` > `Java Application`.

A new window titled "My To-Do List" will pop up, ready for you to use.

## üìù Learning Experience

This task was an excellent introduction to desktop GUI development in Java. I gained hands-on experience with:
-   Creating and configuring Swing components like `JFrame`, `JList`, and `JButton`.
-   Managing complex layouts using `BorderLayout` and `FlowLayout`.
-   Implementing event-driven programming with `ActionListener`.
-   Separating the data model (`DefaultListModel`) from the view (`JList`).

This project has solidified my understanding of how to build interactive and user-friendly desktop applications in Java.
